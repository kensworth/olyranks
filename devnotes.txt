npm run start (defined in package.json) runs server.js using node.js
server.js is an express.js server which handles all requests to the site
express runs as the webserver itself, loads whole app in memory, and waits for http requests to respond to, never touches file system again
gulp transpiles react code on save, and nodemon restarts the server after each change
mongodb is the bson database that holds all profiles
the app uses flux architecture, meaning view->action->dispatcher->store->view one way flow
